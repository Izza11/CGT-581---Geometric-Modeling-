# CGT-581---Geometric-Modeling-

Modeling with Bezier cubics:

By pressin 'A' the system will add a control points and by 'Z' it will delete the last one.

By pressing 'P' C1 continuity is enforced and the system automatically creates a new point accordingly.

By pressing 'D' curve is displayed by de Casteljau algorithm.

Multiple criteria implented as the stop condition for de Casteljau algorithm for subdivision:
  - Control points are in one pixel
  - Area of the control polygon is small
